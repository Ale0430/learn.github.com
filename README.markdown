Learn.GitHub.com
================

This is the code and data behind [learn.github.com](http://learn.github.com). 
The page content lives in the pages/ directory and is compiled into the HTML 
output in p/. Normally, generated files like these wouldn't be checked into
source control, but it's required for the
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) hosting.

If you edit a page, please remember to run 'rake' to recompile the site
and create a single commit including both your source and generated
files. This makes it as easy as possible for others to work with your
changes.

Dependencies, Getting Started
-----------------------------

Compiling the site requires maruku, which can be installed with:

    sudo gem install maruku

Once you've done that, just run rake to compile the site:

    rake
